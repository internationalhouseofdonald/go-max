          <h3>Infusionworx.com</h3>
          <p>Infusionworx.com is an online restaurant. My goal here is to 
            provide customers with a food delivery service at the click of a mouse. 
            Although this project has seen a few difficulties, most of the problems
            arise from a lack of funding. The API's are all installed, but the important 
            ones, like Authorize.net and Google Maps have been disabled.
          </p>
          <h5>This Website was Created with PHP</h5>
          <p>
            Because this website was created with PHP, the source code is proprietary.
            You can always view the HTML and CSS by opening up the Developer's Tools in 
            your browser.

          <h3>Infusionworx.com</h3>
          <p>Infusionworx.com is an online restaurant. My goal here is to 
            create a website that allows customers to place an order online
            and have fresh food delivered to their home with the click of a mouse. 
            Although this project has seen a few difficulties, most of the problems
            arise from lack of funds. I have thought about creating a Kickstarter, but
            as you will see later, I have also started another project called Cloudbackr that 
            is very similar to Kickstarter.
