          <h3>Infusionworx</h3>
          <p>Infusionworx is an online restaurant. My goal here is to 
            provide customers with a food delivery service at the click of a mouse. 
            Although this project has seen a few difficulties, most of the problems
            arise from a lack of funding. The API's are all installed, but the important 
            ones, like Authorize.net and Google Maps have been disabled.

            Because this website was created with PHP, the source code is proprietary.
            You can always view the HTML and CSS by opening up the Developer's Tools in

          <h3>Spartan Valet</h3>
          <p>Spartan Valet is designed to be a mobile application. It is a fully functional, 
            responsive web-app with a real database. The app is designed to help a 
            valet runner remember where he or she parked his or her cars for the night.
            Parts of this application are still in development like the "Tracking" feature
            that allows the runner to locate a car on a realtime map.

          <h3>Nightmares</h3>
          <p>
            Nightmares was created by the developers at Unity Game Development. Part of 
            my job as a web developer is to create robust animations and to provide
            my customers and users alike with the best possible experience. Yes, this project
            did come with a guide, but I assure you it was no easy task. Let this serve as
            an example of the rich UX/UI that Maximum Development brings to the table.
