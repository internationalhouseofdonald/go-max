          <p>Infusionworx is an online restaurant. My goal here is to 
            provide customers with a food delivery service at the click of a mouse. 
            Although this project has seen a few difficulties, most of the problems
            arise from a lack of funding. The API's are all installed, but the important 
            ones, like Authorize.net and Google Maps have been disabled.

          <p>Spartan Valet is designed to be a mobile application. It is a fully functional, 
            responsive web-app with a real database. This app is designed to help a 
            valet runner remember where he or she parked his or her cars for the night.
            Parts of this application are still in development like the "Tracking" feature
            that allows the runner to locate a car on a realtime map.

          <h3>Nightmares</h3>
          <p>
            Nightmares was created by the developers at Unity Game Development. Part of 
            my job as a web developer is to create robust animations and to provide
            my customers and users alike with the best possible experience. Yes, this project
            did come with a guide, but I assure you it was no easy task. Let this serve as
            an example of the rich UX/UI that Maximum Development brings to the table.

          <h3>Hangman</h3>
          <p>
            Hangman is a simple game created with HTML5 and ECMAScript. I had to create this in order
            to apply for Hack Reactor, a full-stack bootcamp, but I never went because someone in my
            immediate family thought it was "too risky." Nevertheless, it's still kind of fun to play.
            <h5>TODO:</h5>
            I need to add more words and a "letters guessed" component.

            <h3>Rush</h3>
            <p>
              Rush is an HTML5 game created with CreateJS (similar to Flash). This is another project where I had a guide
              and assets to work with, but I had to put it together myself. The object of the game is to jump onto platforms
              of varying sizes and over the obstacles that are moving on those platforms. Your player is constantly running so
              you have to be quick!
